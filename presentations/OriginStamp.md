1. The Problem: The Digital Authenticity Crisis
In the age of advanced generative AI, the digital world is facing a fundamental crisis of trust. It is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish authentic, human-created work from content generated by machines. This flood of AI content devalues the skill, time, and creativity of human artists, writers, and developers, while also creating significant challenges for provenance, copyright, and digital commerce. The market lacks a reliable standard for verifying the true origin and effort behind a digital asset.
2. Our Solution: A Paradigm Shift from Detection to Provenance
OriginStamp is not an AI detection tool. Instead, it offers a more fundamental and proactive solution: a decentralized protocol for Proof of Human Process.
We provide creators with the tools to generate an unforgeable, on-chain certificate of origin for any digital or physical work. This certificate doesn't just point to the final file; it contains the entire, immutable history of its creation, answering the crucial questions of who, when, and how a piece was made.
3. How It Works: The Three Pillars of Trust
The OriginStamp workflow is designed to be seamless and non-intrusive, integrating directly into a creator's existing process.
Verified Identity & Session Initiation:
A creator begins by authenticating using Internet Identity, linking their secure, hardware-based identity to a new project. They initiate a "Creation Session" within the OriginStamp dApp, which creates a dedicated, secure on-chain log for their work.
Immutable Process Logging:
Through a simple plugin in their native creative software (e.g., Photoshop, VS Code, Ableton), key creative actions are automatically and periodically recorded to the project's on-chain log. These records can include metadata like "New layer created," "Brush tool used," periodic file hashes, or code commit hashes, each with an immutable timestamp.
The Certificate NFT:
Upon completion, the creator finalizes the session. This action mints a final Certificate NFT. This NFT is a container holding the final asset's hash and, most importantly, a cryptographic link to the entire, unchangeable on-chain log of its creation process.
4. The Verification Experience
Anyone can verify an OriginStamp asset. By scanning a QR code or visiting a public verification page, a user is presented with a clear, interactive dashboard. This dashboard displays the full creation timeline, allowing a potential buyer or collector to see the entire history and compare the on-chain process data with the final work, providing unparalleled confidence in its authenticity.
5. Why Internet Computer (ICP)?
This project is uniquely suited for the Internet Computer ecosystem for several critical reasons:
Reverse Gas Model: This is essential. It allows the platform to cover the small, frequent transaction costs of logging, providing a frictionless experience for creators. They can focus on creating, not on paying for every recorded action.
On-Chain Data Storage: ICP's architecture allows for the efficient and affordable storage of the extensive log data directly on-chain, ensuring the provenance record is truly permanent and decentralized.
Internet Identity: Provides a built-in, secure, and user-friendly authentication system without the need for traditional seed phrases, which is crucial for linking a work to a real identity.
Performance: ICP's speed and fast finality are necessary to handle the real-time logging of creative actions without interrupting the creator's flow.
6. Hackathon Goal (MVP)
Our goal for the WCHL 2025 hackathon is to build a functional Minimum Viable Product that includes:
The core canisters for project initiation and immutable logging.
A proof-of-concept plugin for a web-based text editor.
The public-facing verification dashboard to display the on-chain process history.
